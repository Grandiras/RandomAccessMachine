# RandomAccessMachine

RandomAccessMachine is a project that simulates a random access machine (RAM). It includes an interpreter for executing instructions, a demo application, and various components for managing settings and services.

There is also a feature-rich text editor that supports syntax highlighting (soonâ„¢), auto-save, and localization. The editor is built using the Windows Community Toolkit and Microsoft.UI.Xaml.
