    "# Sound Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound waves are a type of mechanical wave that propagate through a medium, such as air, water, or solids. They are created by vibrating objects, which cause the particles in the medium to vibrate and transfer energy from one point to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound waves can be described by several properties, including frequency, wavelength, amplitude, and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency (f) refers to the number of complete cycles of vibration per second and is measured in Hertz (Hz). It determines the pitch of the sound, with higher frequencies corresponding to higher pitches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wavelength (Î») is the distance between two consecutive points in a wave that are in phase. It is measured in meters (m) and is inversely proportional to the frequency of the wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amplitude (A) represents the maximum displacement of particles in the medium from their equilibrium position. It determines the loudness or intensity of the sound, with larger amplitudes corresponding to louder sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speed (v) is the rate at which the wave propagates through the medium. It is determined by the properties of the medium and is typically measured in meters per second (m/s).\n"
